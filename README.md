UIWear modifications of AOSP framework base repo

This is a modified version of AOSP framework that supports:
1. Extracting bitmap associating along with Accessibility API
2. Make the background app being active by using *setAppBackgroundAlive* API

Combining these functionalities with UIWear, it does achieve the goal of auto-generating companion apps and I/O multiplexing.
